A SwiftUI vocabulary and grammar reference app for German learners. GermanCards keeps a personal word-card library on device, supports spoken German pronunciation through the system speech synthesizer, and runs on iPhone, iPad, and native macOS.

## Highlights

- Build German vocabulary cards with notes, examples, gender, plural forms, and related grammar context.
- Study an A1–C1 grammar book in Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, or English.
- Search and review saved cards from a local personal dictionary.
- Listen to German pronunciation using Apple system voices.
- Export and import `GermanCardsDictionary.json` for backup, AirDrop transfer, Git storage, or cloud sync.
- Use the same SwiftUI codebase across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.

## Platforms

GermanCards supports:

- iPhone and iPad on iOS/iPadOS 18 or later
- macOS 15 or later as a native macOS app
- Apple silicon and Intel Macs through the GitHub Actions universal macOS package

## macOS Builds

The GitHub Actions workflow builds a universal native macOS app with both `arm64` and `x86_64` slices. Each run uploads an artifact named `GermanCards-macOS-universal` containing:

- `GermanCards-macOS-universal.pkg` - installer package for `/Applications`
- `GermanCards-macOS-universal.dmg` - drag-and-drop disk image
- `GermanCards-macOS-universal.zip` - zipped `.app` bundle for quick testing

Release builds use ad-hoc signing for the app bundle, but they are not Developer ID signed or notarized.

### Opening on macOS

Because the macOS package is not notarized, Gatekeeper may block the first launch. To open it:

1. Install the app from the `.dmg`, `.pkg`, or `.zip` release asset.
2. Try opening `GermanCards.app` once.
3. Open System Settings > Privacy & Security.
4. Find the blocked GermanCards message and choose Open Anyway.
5. Confirm the prompt to launch the app.

Only do this if you trust the source code and the release asset you downloaded.

## iOS Builds

Each GitHub Actions run also uploads `GermanCards-iOS-unsigned`, containing an unsigned `.ipa` and a zipped `.app` bundle. Tagged releases include both files alongside the macOS packages.

The iOS artifacts cannot be installed directly. Apple requires them to be signed with your own Developer identity and a provisioning profile before device installation; the repository does not require or store those credentials.

## Release Disclaimer

Release builds are provided for convenience only. They are ad-hoc signed, not Developer ID signed, not notarized by Apple, and not reviewed by Apple. The software is distributed as-is, without warranty, support commitment, or liability for data loss, system issues, security decisions, privacy consequences, or any other damage arising from installation or use. You are responsible for deciding whether to run the app, reviewing the source code, and building it yourself if you need stronger trust guarantees.

## Local Development

Open the project in Xcode 16.4 or later:

```bash
open GermanCards.xcodeproj
```

Build from the command line for iOS:

```bash
xcodebuild \
  -project GermanCards.xcodeproj \
  -scheme GermanCards \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO \
  build
```

Build a universal native macOS app locally:

```bash
xcodebuild \
  -project GermanCards.xcodeproj \
  -scheme GermanCards \
  -configuration Release \
  -destination 'generic/platform=macOS' \
  ARCHS='arm64 x86_64' \
  ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO \
  build
```

## App Icon

The primary app icon is managed through `Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset`. The restored dark Mac icon keeps its rounded transparent silhouette, and `Assets.xcassets/AppIconMacLight.appiconset` contains a matching light Mac variant at every required size. The native macOS app updates its Dock icon when the effective system appearance changes.

## Signing

Personal signing values stay out of git. For local device installs, copy the example config and add your Apple Developer Team ID:

```bash
cp Config/Signing.example.xcconfig Config/Signing.local.xcconfig
```

`Config/Signing.local.xcconfig` is ignored by git. Do not commit private keys, provisioning profiles, App Store Connect credentials, or personal team identifiers.

## Data Model

GermanCards does not ship a third-party dictionary. Saved cards are stored as the user's own local dictionary and can be exported as `GermanCardsDictionary.json` from Settings.
